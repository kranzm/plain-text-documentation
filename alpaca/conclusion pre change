Alpacas are among the oldest and most useful pack animals to ever bebe domesticated. 
Cultures in the Central Andes began domesticating the species over 6000 years ago and their efforts in 
breeding have led to the diverse appearances of Alpacas we see today. Uses for the animal have stayed 
consistent: food, fiber, and work. This smaller cousin of the llama is still present in huge numbers
throughout the Andean Highland in addition to the many alpaca farms scattered over farmland. 
The uses of the Alpaca have never declined and they will be around for a long time as mankindâ€™s fuzzy helper.
