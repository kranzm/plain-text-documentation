Alpacas are among the oldest and most useful pack animals to ever be domesticated. Cultures in the Central Andes began domesticating the species over 6000 years ago and their efforts in breeding have led to the diverse appearances of Alpacas we see today. Uses for the animal have stayed consistent: food, fiber, and work. This smaller cousin of the llama is still present in huge numbers throughout the Andean Highland in addition to the many alpaca farms scattered over farmland. The uses of the Alpaca have never declined and they will be around for a long time as mankindâ€™s fuzzy helper. 

Are there wild alpacas in the Andean Highland? When you say food do you mean people eat alpacas? These would probably be addressed earlier in the paper anyways.
