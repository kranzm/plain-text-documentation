%Editing of Alpaca Paper

Alpacas are found throughout the Americas, Australia, and Europe. This cousin of the llama has a deep history
that begins in the mountains of South America with the native people who ensured its survival. Today they are farmed 
for their high quality fibers that, while once used for personal knitting, are becoming increasingly popular 
in the fashion industry. Alpaca history and their long standing contribution to textiles make them one of the most 
interesting farm animals.  

Alpacas were domesticated over 6000 years ago in South America. Andean mythology 
believed them to be a gift from the Earth Mother, Pachmana. We owe the great variety 
of Alpacas today to the shepherding and breeding work of South American 
cultures like the Incas. Alpacas were prized in South American cultures for their usefulness
in textiles, food, and labor. When the Spanish invaded and conquered South America in the 16th
century they saw a civilization built on products provided by the cultivation of the local alpaca herds.
In an effort to subdue the indigenous population, the Spanish slaughtered 90% of the alpacas and 
the species survived only through the hard work of the native peoples who fled to the hills. Alpaca
fibers were rediscovered in the 19th century by Western culture and played a role in the textile 
development of the industrial revolution. Since that time Alpacas have been continually bred for their fibers. 

Alpaca is considered to be one of the highest quality fibers on the market. Fibers are classified in one of 
two categories: 95% of alpacas produce huacaya fibers (fluffy and crimped fibers) and the remaining 
5% of alpacas produce suri fibers (long and straight fibers). Both varieties come in a large array 
of colors. The fashion industry's interest in alpaca wool has been growing, leading to an increasing number 
of alpacas farmed in Europe and around the world. Unlike many other farmed animals, alpacas are not difficult 
to work with and anyone can start their own herd with only a bit of education and land. These traits helped 
skyrocket alpaca farming to a mainstream business venture that benefits society and can be personally rewarding.

Alpacas are interesting animals with even more interesting history. They survived through great persecution
and were the cornerstone of many civilizations throughout history. Diversity in their coat fibers for textiles 
keep them enthroned as an important animal to breed and farm. Demand for the alpaca has been strong for 6000
years—starting with the Incas—and is still growing in the 21st century.
