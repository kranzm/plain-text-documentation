%Revision of Alpaca Paper

Alpacas are found throughout the Americas, Australia, and England. This cousin of the llama has a deep history
that begins in the mountains of South America with the native people who ensured their survival. Today they are farmed 
for their high quality fibers that, while once used for personal knitting, are becoming increasingly popular 
in the fashion industry. Alpaca history and their contribution to textiles make them one of the most interesting
farm animals.  

Alpacas were domesticated over 6000 years ago in South America. Andean mythology 
believed them to be a gift from the Earth Mother, Pachmana. We owe the great variety 
of Alpacas present today to the sheperding and breeding work of South American 
cultures like the Incas. Alpacas were prized in South American culture for their usefullness
in textiles, food, and labor. When the Spanish invaded and conquered South America in the 16th
century they saw a civilization built on textiles provided by the cultivation of the local alpaca herds.
In an effort to subdue the indiginous population the Spanish slaughtered 90% of the alpacas. 
The species survived only through the hard work of the native peoples who fled to the hills. Alpaca
fibers were rediscovered in the 19th century and played a role in the textile area of industrial
revolution. Since that time, Alpacas have been continuially bred for their fibers. 

Alpaca is considered to be one of the highest quality fibers on the market. Fibers are classified in one of 
two categories: 95% of alpacas produce huacaya fibers (fluffy and crimped fibers) and the remaining 
5% of alpacas produce suri fibers (long and straight fibers). Both varities come in a large array 
of colors and are considered luxury fibers. The fashion industry's interest in the fiber has been 
growing which increased the number of alpacas farmed in Europe. To help meet the growing demand 
for alpaca wool, many breeding programs are running to selectively breed alpacas with the most desirable traits.
Unlike many other farmed animals, alpacas are not difficult to work with and anyone can start their own herd with only
a bit of education and land. These traits helped skyrocket Alpaca farming to a mainstream business venture that benefits
multiple areas of society.

Alpacas are an interesting animal with an even more intresting history. They survived through great pursectution
and were the cornerstone of many civilizations throughout history. Diversity in their coat fibers for textiles 
keep them enthroned as an important animal to breed and farm. Demand for the alpaca has been strong for 6000 years 
starting with the Incas and is still growing in the 21st century.
